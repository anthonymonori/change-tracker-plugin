# Change Tracker Plugin
A Gradle plugin to discover the dependency graph between the modules and run specific tasks only on changed modules and his dependents.

When we're working on a modular project, we don't need to run our verification tasks on all modules every time you open a pull request, we can only run on the modules affected by the changes and all his dependents, with this approach we can save a lot of time on the CI giving faster feedback about the changes to the developers.

To exemplify, take the following project structure as an example:

If you apply changes to the `:profile-service` module, you only need to run your verification tasks on `:profile-service`, `:profile`, and `:app`. It's safe to skip the verification tasks on all the other modules because they don't depend on `:profile-service`, and can't be affected by these changes.

## Installation

Apply the plugin to your root project `build.gradle` and add the configuration block.

```groovy 
plugins {
    id 'com.ismaeldivita.changetracker' version '0.7.4'
}

...

changeTracker {
    tasks = ['lint','testDebugUnitTest']
    whitelist = [':app']
    blacklist = [':network',':featureA']
    reevaluate = [':sharedTest']
    branch = "master"
    remote = "origin"
}
```

- `tasks`: List of tasks the plugin will need to create.
- `branch`: Name of the branch that should compare to the current one to extract the diff.
- `whitelist` (optional): List of modules that should **always** run.
- `blacklist` (optional): List of modules that should **never** run.
- `reevaluate` (optional): List of modules that will trigger the task for all modules
- `remote` (optional): Name of the remote repository.

## Usage
<img align="right" hspace="15" width="270" src="./assets/tasks.png"/>

The plugin will generate new tasks on the root project for each task provided on the configuration with the following pattern `${taskName}ChangedModules`.

These generated tasks will run the `changedModules` task to get the list of changed modules and for each one will call the given task.

Taking as an example the configuration above the plugin will generate two new tasks `lintChangedModules` and `testDebugUnitTestChangedModules`.

To run your task:

```
./gradlew testDebugUnitTestChangedModules
```

You can override the default branch used for the comparison when running your command. This is useful when you're using the plugin on pull requests and each pull request may have different base branches.
```
./gradlew testDebugUnitTestChangedModules -Pbranch=dev
```

## Notes
- This plugin assumes you use GIT as your VCS.
- Any changes to the root project or `buildSrc` will trigger the task for all modules.
- Test configurations will not be tracked since dependency cycles could be created for test purposes, which is not supported by this plugin. If you have a shared test library project and want to trigger the tasks on his dependents check the `reevaluate` configuration.
